About Red Hat Software Collections\\nFor certain applications, more recent versions of some software components are often needed in order to use their latest new features. Red Hat\\nSoftware Collections  is a Red Hat of fering that provides a set of dynamic programming languages, database servers, and various related packages\\nthat are either more recent than their equivalent versions included in the base Red Hat Enterprise Linux system, or are available for this system for the\\nfirst time.\\nRed Hat Software Collections 3.5 is available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7; selected previously released components also for Red Hat\\nEnterprise Linux 6. For a complete list of components that are distributed as part of Red Hat Software Collections and a brief summary of their features,\\nsee Section 1.2, “Main Features” .\\nRed Hat Software Collections does not replace the default system tools provided with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\\nInstead, a parallel set of tools is installed in the /opt/ directory and can be optionally enabled per application by the user using the supplied scl utility .\\nThe default versions of Perl or PostgreSQL, for example, remain those provided by the base Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.\\nNote\\nIn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, similar components are provided as Application Streams .\\nAll Red Hat Software Collections components are fully supported under Red Hat Enterprise Linux Subscription Level Agreements, are functionally\\ncomplete, and are intended for production use. Important bug fix and security errata are issued to Red Hat Software Collections subscribers in a similar\\nmanner to Red Hat Enterprise Linux for at least two years from the release of each major version. In each major release stream, each version of a\\nselected component remains backward compatible. For detailed information about length of support for individual components, refer to the Red Hat\\nSoftware Collections Product Life Cycle  document.\\n1.1.1.

Changes in Perl\\nThe new rh-perl530  Software Collection includes Perl 5.30.1 , which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previously released rh-\\nperl526  Software Collection. The new version also deprecates or removes certain language features.\\nNotable changes with significant impact include:\\nThe Math::BigInt::CalcEmu, arybase, and B::Debug modules have been removed\\nFile descriptors are now opened with a close-on-exec flag\\nOpening the same symbol as a file and as a directory handle is no longer allowed\\nSubroutine attributes now must precede subroutine signatures\\nThe :locked and :uniq attributes have been removed\\nComma-less variable lists in formats are no longer allowed\\nA bare << here-document operator is no longer allowed\\nCertain formerly deprecated uses of an unescaped left brace ( {) character in regular expression patterns are no longer permitted\\nThe AUTOLOAD() subroutine can no longer be inherited to non-method functions\\nThe sort pragma no longer allows specifying a sort algorithm\\nThe B::OP::terse() subroutine has been replaced by the B::Concise::b_terse() subroutine\\nThe File::Glob::glob() function has been replaced by the File::Glob::bsd_glob() function\\nThe dump() function now must be invoked fully qualified as CORE::dump()\\nThe yada-yada operator ( ...) is a statement now , it cannot be used as an expression\\nAssigning a non-zero value to the $[ variable now returns a fatal error\\nThe $* and $# variables are no longer allowed\\nDeclaring variables using the my() function in a false condition branch is no longer allowed\\nUsing the sysread() and syswrite() functions on the :utf8 handles now returns a fatal error\\nThe pack() function no longer returns malformed UTF-8 format\\nUnicode code points with a value greater than IV_MAX are no longer allowed\\nUnicode 12.1 is now supported\\nIn addition, the rh-perl530  Software Collection now provides the Library for WWW in Perl (L WP) and other HTTP-related modules in the rh-perl530-perl-\\nlibwww-perl  and rh-perl530-perl-L WP-Protocol-https  RPM packages.\\nFor detailed changes between Perl 5.26  and Perl 5.30.1 , see the upstream change log for versions 5.28.0 , 5.30.0 , and 5.30.1 .\\n1.3.4. Changes in Python\\nThe new rh-python38  Software Collection introduces Python 3.8.0 . Notable enhancements compared to Python 3.6  include:\\nNew Python modules, for example, contextvars, dataclasses, or importlib.resources\\nNew language features, such as assignment expressions (the so-called walrus operator , :=) or positional-only parametersImproved developer experience with the breakpoint() built-in function, the = format string specification, and compatibility between debug and\\nnon-debug builds of Python and extension modules\\nPerformance improvements\\nImproved support for optional static type hints\\nAn addition of the = specifier to formatted string literals (f-strings) for easier debugging\\nUpdated versions of packages, such as pip, requests , or Cython\\nFor detailed changes, see the upstream documentation .\\nNote that similarly to the previously released Python  Software Collections, the rh-python38  Software Collection does not include the same binary\\nbindings to system tools (RPM, DNF , SELinux, and others) that are provided for the base RHEL  7 version of Python .\\n1.3.5. Changes in Ruby\\nThe new rh-ruby27  Software Collection provides Ruby 2.7.1 , which introduces a number of performance improvements, bug and security fixes, and new\\nfeatures.\\nNotable enhancements include:\\nA new Compaction Garbage Collector (GC) has been introduced, which can defragment a fragmented memory space.\\nA new rubygem-racc  package has been added. Ruby yet Another Compiler-Compiler (Racc) now provides a command-line interface for the one-\\ntoken Look-Ahead Left-to-Right – LALR(1) – parser generator .\\nInteractive Ruby Shell ( irb), the bundled Read–Eval–Print Loop (REPL) environment, now supports multi-line editing.\\nPattern matching, frequently used in functional programming languages, has been introduced as an experimental feature.\\nNumbered parameter as the default block parameter has been introduced as an experimental feature.\\nThe following performance improvements have been implemented:\\nFiber cache strategy has been changed to accelerate fiber creation.\\nPerformance of the CGI.escapeHTML method has been improved.\\nPerformance of the Monitor class and MonitorMixin module has been improved.\\nIn addition, automatic conversion of keyword arguments and positional arguments has been deprecated. In Ruby 3.0, positional arguments and keyword\\narguments will be separated. For more information, see the upstream documentation .\\nTo suppress warnings against experimental features, use the -W:no-experimental command-line option. To disable a deprecation warning, use the -\\nW:no-deprecated command-line option or add Warning[:deprecated] = false to your code.\\nFor more information about changes in Ruby 2.7, see the upstream announcement for versions 2.7.0  and 2.7.1 .\\n1.3.6. Changes in Apache httpd\\nThe mod_md module of the httpd24  Software Collection has been updated to version 2.0.8. This update adds a number of features, notably support for\\nversion 2 of the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) certificate issuance and management protocol, which is the Internet\\nEngineering Task Force (IETF) standard (RFC 8555). The original ACMEv1 protocol remains supported but is deprecated by popular service providers.\\nIn addition, a security fix for CVE-2019-10098 in the mod_rewrite module is now available.\\n1.3.7. Changes in V arnish Cache\\nThe rh-varnish6  Software Collection has been updated to version 6.0.6. This release includes numerous bug and security fixes and various minor\\nenhancements.\\nFor detailed changes in Varnish Cache 6.0.6  since the previous Red Hat Software Collections release, see the upstream change log for versions 6.0.3 ,\\n6.0.4 , 6.0.5 , and 6.0.6 .\\n1.3.8. Changes in JDK Mission Control\\nJDK Mission Control, provided by the rh-jmc  Software Collection, has been updated to version 7.1.1. This update includes numerous bug fixes and\\nenhancements, including:\\nMultiple rule optimizations\\nA new JOverflow view based on Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT)\\nA new flame graph view\\nA new way of latency visualization using the High Dynamic Range (HDR) Histogram\\n1.3.9.

Known Issues\\nrh-ruby27 component, BZ# 1836201\\nWhen a custom script requires the Psych YAML parser and afterwards uses the Gem.load_yaml method, running the script fails with the following\\nerror message:\\nsuperclass mismatch for class Mark (TypeError)\\nTo work around this problem, add the gem \\'psych\\' line to the script somewhere above the require \\'psych\\' line:...\\ngem \\'psych\\'\\n...\\nrequire \\'psych\\'\\nGem.load_yaml\\nmultiple components, BZ# 1716378\\nCertain files provided by the Software Collections debuginfo  packages might conflict with the corresponding debuginfo  package files from the base\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux system or from other versions of Red Hat Software Collections components. For example, the python27-python-debuginfo\\npackage files might conflict with the corresponding files from the python-debuginfo  package installed on the core system. Similarly , files from the\\nhttpd24-mod_auth_mellon-debuginfo  package might conflict with similar files provided by the base system mod_auth_mellon-debuginfo  package. To\\nwork around this problem, uninstall the base system debuginfo  package prior to installing the Software Collection debuginfo  package.\\nrh-mysql80 component, BZ# 1646363\\nThe mysql-connector-java database connector does not work with the MySQL  8.0 server . To work around this problem, use the mariadb-java-\\nclient database connector from the rh-mariadb103  Software Collection.\\nrh-mysql80 component, BZ# 1646158\\nThe default character set has been changed to utf8mb4 in MySQL  8.0 but this character set is unsupported by the php-mysqlnd database connector .\\nConsequently , php-mysqlnd fails to connect in the default configuration. To work around this problem, specify a known character set as a parameter\\nof the MySQL  server configuration. For example, modify the /etc/opt/rh/rh-mysql80/my.cnf.d/mysql-server.cnf file to read:\\n[mysqld]\\ncharacter-set-server=utf8\\nhttpd24 component, BZ# 1429006\\nSince httpd 2.4.27 , the mod_http2 module is no longer supported with the default prefork Multi-Processing Module (MPM). To enable HTTP/2\\nsupport, edit the configuration file at /opt/rh/httpd24/root/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/00-mpm.conf and switch to the event or worker MPM.\\nNote that the HTTP/2 server-push feature does not work on the 64-bit ARM architecture, IBM Z, and IBM POWER, little endian.\\nhttpd24 component, BZ# 1327548\\nThe mod_ssl module does not support the ALPN protocol on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, or on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 and earlier .\\nConsequently , clients that support upgrading TLS connections to HTTP/2 only using ALPN are limited to HTTP/1.1 support.\\nhttpd24 component, BZ# 1224763\\nWhen using the mod_proxy_fcgi module with FastCGI Process Manager (PHP-FPM), httpd  uses port 8000 for the FastCGI protocol by default\\ninstead of the correct port 9000. To work around this problem, specify the correct port explicitly in configuration.\\nhttpd24 component, BZ# 1382706\\nWhen SELinux is enabled, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is not passed through to CGI scripts invoked by httpd . As a consequence, in\\nsome cases it is impossible to invoke executables from Software Collections enabled in the /opt/rh/httpd24/service-environment file from CGI\\nscripts run by httpd . To work around this problem, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as desired from within the CGI script.\\nhttpd24 component\\nCompiling external applications against the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) and APR-util libraries from the httpd24  Software Collection is not\\nsupported. The LD_LIBRAR Y_PATH environment variable is not set in httpd24  because it is not required by any application in this\\nSoftware Collection.\\nrh-python35, rh-python36 components, BZ# 1499990\\nThe pytz module, which is used by Babel for time zone support, is not included in the rh-python35 , and rh-python36  Software Collections.\\nConsequently , when the user tries to import the dates module from Babel, a traceback is returned. To work around this problem, install pytz through\\nthe pip package manager from the pypi public repository by using the pip install pytz command.\\nrh-python36 component\\nCertain complex trigonometric functions provided by numpy  might return incorrect values on the 64-bit ARM architecture, IBM Z, and IBM POWER,\\nlittle endian. The AMD64 and Intel 64 architectures are not af fected by this problem.\\npython27 component, BZ# 1330489\\nThe python27-python-pymongo  package has been updated to version 3.2.1. Note that this version is not fully compatible with the previously shipped\\nversion 2.5.2.\\nscl-utils component\\nIn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 and earlier , due to an architecture-specific macro bug in the scl-utils  package, the <collection>/root/usr/lib64/\\ndirectory does not have the correct package ownership on the 64-bit ARM architecture and on IBM POWER, little endian. As a consequence, this\\ndirectory is not removed when a Software Collection is uninstalled. To work around this problem, manually delete <collection>/root/usr/lib64/\\nwhen removing a Software Collection.\\nmaven component\\nWhen the user has installed both the Red Hat Enterprise Linux system version of maven-local  package and the rh-maven*-maven-local  package,\\nXMvn , a tool used for building Java RPM packages, run from the Maven Software Collection tries to read the configuration file from the base systemand fails. To work around this problem, uninstall the maven-local  package from the base Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.\\nperl component\\nIt is impossible to install more than one mod_perl.so library . As a consequence, it is not possible to use the mod_perl module from more than one\\nPerl Software Collection.\\npostgresql component\\nThe rh-postgresql9*  packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 do not provide the sepgsql module as this feature requires installation of libselinux\\nversion 2.0.99, which is not available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\\nhttpd, mariadb, mongodb, mysql, nodejs, perl, php, python, ruby, and ror components, BZ# 1072319\\nWhen uninstalling the httpd24 , rh-mariadb* , rh-mongodb* , rh-mysql* , rh-nodejs* , rh-perl* , rh-php* , python27 , rh-python* , rh-ruby* , or rh-ror*  packages,\\nthe order of uninstalling can be relevant due to ownership of dependent packages. As a consequence, some directories and files might not be\\nremoved properly and might remain on the system.\\nmariadb, mysql components, BZ# 119461 1\\nSince MariaDB 10  and MySQL  5.6, the rh-mariadb*-mariadb-server  and rh-mysql*-mysql-server  packages no longer provide the test database by\\ndefault. Although this database is not created during initialization, the grant tables are prefilled with the same values as when test was created by\\ndefault. As a consequence, upon a later creation of the test or test_* databases, these databases have less restricted access rights than is default\\nfor new databases.\\nAdditionally , when running benchmarks, the run-all-tests script no longer works out of the box with example parameters. You need to create a test\\ndatabase before running the tests and specify the database name in the --database parameter . If the parameter is not specified, test is taken by\\ndefault but you need to make sure the test database exist.\\nmariadb, mysql, postgresql, mongodb components\\nRed Hat Software Collections contains the MySQL  5.7, MySQL  8.0, MariaDB 10.2 , MariaDB 10.3 , PostgreSQL  9.6, PostgreSQL  10,\\nPostgreSQL  12, MongoDB 3.4 , and MongoDB 3.6  databases. The core Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 provides earlier versions of the MySQL  and\\nPostgreSQL  databases (client library and daemon). The core Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 provides earlier versions of the MariaDB  and PostgreSQL\\ndatabases (client library and daemon). Client libraries are also used in database connectors for dynamic languages, libraries, and so on.\\nThe client library packaged in the Red Hat Software Collections database packages in the PostgreSQL  component is not supposed to be used, as it\\nis included only for purposes of server utilities and the daemon. Users are instead expected to use the system library and the database connectors\\nprovided with the core system.\\nA protocol, which is used between the client library and the daemon, is stable across database versions, so, for example, using the PostgreSQL  9.2\\nclient library with the PostgreSQL  9.4 or 9.5 daemon works as expected.\\nThe core Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 do not include the client library for MongoDB . In order to use this client library\\nfor your application, you should use the client library from Red Hat Software Collections and always use the scl enable ... call every time you run\\nan application linked against this MongoDB  client library .\\nmariadb, mysql, mongodb components\\nMariaDB, MySQL, and MongoDB do not make use of the /opt/provider/collection/root prefix when creating log files. Note that log files are saved\\nin the /var/opt/provider/collection/log/ directory , not in /opt/provider/collection/root/var/log/.\\nOther Notes\\nrh-ruby*, rh-python*, rh-php* components\\nUsing Software Collections on a read-only NFS has several limitations.\\nRuby gems cannot be installed while the rh-ruby*  Software Collection is on a read-only NFS. Consequently , for example, when the user tries to\\ninstall the ab gem using the gem install ab command, an error message is displayed, for example:\\nERROR:  While executing gem ... (Errno::EROFS)\\n    Read-only file system @ dir_s_mkdir - /opt/rh/rh-ruby22/root/usr/local/share/gems\\nThe same problem occurs when the user tries to update or install gems from an external source by running the bundle update or bundle\\ninstall commands.\\nWhen installing Python packages on a read-only NFS using the Python Package Index (PyPI), running the pip command fails with an error\\nmessage similar to this:\\nRead-only file system: \\'/opt/rh/rh-python34/root/usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages/ipython-3.1.0.dist-info\\'\\nInstalling packages from PHP  Extension and Application Repository (PEAR) on a read-only NFS using the pear command fails with the error\\nmessage:\\nCannot install, php_dir for channel \"pear.php.net\" is not writeable by the current user\\nThis is an expected behavior .\\nhttpd component\\nLanguage modules for Apache are supported only with the Red Hat Software Collections version of Apache httpd  and not with the Red Hat\\nEnterprise Linux system versions of httpd . For example, the mod_wsgi module from the rh-python35  Collection can be used only with the httpd24\\nCollection.\\nall componentsSince Red Hat Software Collections 2.0, configuration files, variable data, and runtime data of individual Collections are stored in dif ferent directories\\nthan in previous versions of Red Hat Software Collections.\\ncoreutils, util-linux, screen components\\nSome utilities, for example, su, login , or screen , do not export environment settings in all cases, which can lead to unexpected results. It is therefore\\nrecommended to use sudo  instead of su and set the env_keep environment variable in the /etc/sudoers file. Alternatively , you can run commands\\nin a reverse order; for example:\\nsu -l postgres -c \"scl enable rh-postgresql94 psql\"\\ninstead of\\nscl enable rh-postgresql94 bash\\nsu -l postgres -c psql\\nWhen using tools like screen  or login , you can use the following command to preserve the environment settings:\\nsource /opt/rh/<collection_name>/enable\\npython component\\nWhen the user tries to install more than one scldevel  package from the python27  and rh-python*  Software Collections, a transaction check error\\nmessage is returned. This is an expected behavior because the user can install only one set of the macro files provided by the packages\\n(%scl_python, %scl_prefix_python).\\nphp component\\nWhen the user tries to install more than one scldevel  package from the rh-php*  Software Collections, a transaction check error message is returned.\\nThis is an expected behavior because the user can install only one set of the macro files provided by the packages ( %scl_php, %scl_prefix_php).\\nruby component\\nWhen the user tries to install more than one scldevel  package from the rh-ruby*  Software Collections, a transaction check error message is returned.\\nThis is an expected behavior because the user can install only one set of the macro files provided by the packages ( %scl_ruby, %scl_prefix_ruby).\\nperl component\\nWhen the user tries to install more than one scldevel  package from the rh-perl*  Software Collections, a transaction check error message is returned.\\nThis is an expected behavior because the user can install only one set of the macro files provided by the packages ( %scl_perl, %scl_prefix_perl).\\nnginx component\\nWhen the user tries to install more than one scldevel  package from the rh-nginx*  Software Collections, a transaction check error message is returned.\\nThis is an expected behavior because the user can install only one set of the macro files provided by the packages ( %scl_nginx,\\n%scl_prefix_nginx).\\n1.6. Deprecated Functionality\\nhttpd24 component, BZ# 1434053\\nPreviously , in an SSL/TLS configuration requiring name-based SSL  virtual host selection, the mod_ssl module rejected requests with a 400 Bad\\nRequest error , if the host name provided in the Host: header did not match the host name provided in a Server Name Indication (SNI) header . Such\\nrequests are no longer rejected if the configured SSL/TLS security parameters are identical between the selected virtual hosts, in-line with the\\nbehavior of upstream mod_ssl.\\nChapter 2. Installation\\nThis chapter describes in detail how to get access to the content set, install Red Hat Software Collections 3.5 on the system, and rebuild Red Hat\\nSoftware Collections.\\n2.1. Getting Access to Red Hat Software Collections\\nThe Red Hat Software Collections content set is available to customers with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 subscriptions\\nlisted at https://access.redhat.com/solutions/472793 .

Using Red Hat Subscription Management\\nIf your system is registered with Red Hat Subscription Management, complete the following steps to attach the subscription that provides access to the\\nrepository for Red Hat Software Collections and enable the repository:\\n1. Display a list of all subscriptions that are available for your system and determine the pool ID of a subscription that provides Red Hat\\nSoftware Collections. To do so, type the following at a shell prompt as root:subscription-manager list --available\\nFor each available subscription, this command displays its name, unique identifier , expiration date, and other details related to it. The pool ID is\\nlisted on a line beginning with Pool Id.\\n2. Attach the appropriate subscription to your system by running the following command as root:\\nsubscription-manager attach --pool= pool_id\\nReplace pool_id  with the pool ID you determined in the previous step. To verify the list of subscriptions your system has currently attached, type as\\nroot:\\nsubscription-manager list --consumed\\n3. Display the list of available Yum list repositories to retrieve repository metadata and determine the exact name of the Red Hat Software Collections\\nrepositories. As root, type:\\nsubscription-manager repos --list\\nOr alternatively , run yum repolist all for a brief list.\\nThe repository names depend on the specific version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux you are using and are in the following format:\\nrhel-variant-rhscl-6-rpms\\nrhel-variant-rhscl-6-debug-rpms\\nrhel-variant-rhscl-6-source-rpms\\nrhel-server-rhscl-6-eus-rpms\\nrhel-server-rhscl-6-eus-source-rpms\\nrhel-server-rhscl-6-eus-debug-rpms\\nrhel-variant-rhscl-7-rpms\\nrhel-variant-rhscl-7-debug-rpms\\nrhel-variant-rhscl-7-source-rpms\\nrhel-server-rhscl-7-eus-rpms\\nrhel-server-rhscl-7-eus-source-rpms\\nrhel-server-rhscl-7-eus-debug-rpms>\\nReplace variant  with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux system variant, that is, server or workstation. Note that Red Hat Software Collections is\\nsupported neither on the Client nor on the ComputeNode variant.\\n4. Enable the appropriate repository by running the following command as root:\\nsubscription-manager repos --enable repository\\nOnce the subscription is attached to the system, you can install Red Hat Software Collections as described in Section 2.2, “Installing Red Hat\\nSoftware Collections” . For more information on how to register your system using Red Hat Subscription Management and associate it with subscriptions,\\nsee Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager .\\nNote\\nSubscription through RHN is no longer available.\\n2.1.2.

Installing Red Hat Software Collections\\nRed Hat Software Collections is distributed as a collection of RPM packages that can be installed, updated, and uninstalled by using the standard\\npackage management tools included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Note that a valid subscription is required to install Red Hat Software Collections on\\nyour system. For detailed instructions on how to associate your system with an appropriate subscription and get access to Red Hat\\nSoftware Collections, see Section 2.1, “Getting Access to Red Hat Software Collections” .\\nUse of Red Hat Software Collections 3.5 requires the removal of any earlier pre-release versions. If you have installed any previous version of Red Hat\\nSoftware Collections 2.1 component, uninstall it from your system and install the new version as described in the Section 2.3, “Uninstalling Red Hat\\nSoftware Collections”  and Section 2.2.1, “Installing Individual Software Collections”  sections.\\nThe in-place upgrade from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is not supported by Red Hat Software Collections. As a\\nconsequence, the installed Software Collections might not work correctly after the upgrade. If you want to upgrade from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 to\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7, it is strongly recommended to remove all Red Hat Software Collections packages, perform the in-place upgrade, update the\\nRed Hat Software Collections repository , and install the Software Collections packages again. It is advisable to back up all data before upgrading.\\n2.2.1. Installing Individual Software Collections\\nTo install any of the Software Collections that are listed in Table 1.1, “Red Hat Software Collections Components” , install the corresponding meta\\npackage by typing the following at a shell prompt as root:\\nyum install software_collection ...\\nReplace software_collection  with a space-separated list of Software Collections you want to install. For example, to install php54  and rh-mariadb100 ,\\ntype as root:~]# yum install rh-php72 rh-mariadb102\\nThis installs the main meta package for the selected Software Collection and a set of required packages as its dependencies. For information on how to\\ninstall additional packages such as additional modules, see Section 2.2.2, “Installing Optional Packages” .\\n2.2.2. Installing Optional Packages\\nEach component of Red Hat Software Collections is distributed with a number of optional packages that are not installed by default. To list all packages\\nthat are part of a certain Software Collection but are not installed on your system, type the following at a shell prompt:\\nyum list available software_collection -\\\\*\\nTo install any of these optional packages, type as root:\\nyum install package_name ...\\nReplace package_name  with a space-separated list of packages that you want to install. For example, to install the rh-perl526-perl-CP AN and rh-\\nperl526-perl-Archive-T ar, type:\\n~]# yum install rh-perl526-perl-CPAN rh-perl526-perl-Archive-Tar\\n2.2.3. Installing Debugging Information\\nTo install debugging information for any of the Red Hat Software Collections packages, make sure that the yum-utils  package is installed and type the\\nfollowing command as root:\\ndebuginfo-install package_name\\nFor example, to install debugging information for the rh-ruby25-ruby  package, type:\\n~]# debuginfo-install rh-ruby25-ruby\\nNote that you need to have access to the repository with these packages. If your system is registered with Red Hat Subscription Management, enable\\nthe rhel-variant-rhscl-6-debug-rpms or rhel-variant-rhscl-7-debug-rpms repository as described in Section 2.1.1, “Using Red Hat\\nSubscription Management” . For more information on how to get access to debuginfo packages, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/9907 .\\n2.3. Uninstalling Red Hat Software Collections\\nTo uninstall any of the Software Collections components, type the following at a shell prompt as root:\\nyum remove software_collection \\\\*\\nReplace software_collection  with the Software Collection component you want to uninstall.\\nNote that uninstallation of the packages provided by Red Hat Software Collections does not af fect the Red Hat Enterprise Linux system versions of\\nthese tools.\\n2.4. Rebuilding Red Hat Software Collections\\n<collection>-build  packages are not provided by default. If you wish to rebuild a collection and do not want or cannot use the rpmbuild --define \\'scl\\nfoo\\' command, you first need to rebuild the metapackage, which provides the <collection>-build  package.\\nNote that existing collections should not be rebuilt with dif ferent content. To add new packages into an existing collection, you need to create a new\\ncollection containing the new packages and make it dependent on packages from the original collection. The original collection has to be used without\\nchanges.\\nFor detailed information on building Software Collections, refer to the Red Hat Software Collections Packaging Guide .\\nChapter 3. Usage\\nThis chapter describes the necessary steps for using Red Hat Software Collections 3.5, and deploying applications that use Red Hat\\nSoftware Collections.\\n3.1. Using Red Hat Software Collections\\n3.1.1. Running an Executable from a Software Collection\\nTo run an executable from a particular Software Collection, type the following command at a shell prompt:\\nscl enable software_collection ... \\'command...\\'\\nOr, alternatively , use the following command:\\nscl enable software_collection ... -- command...\\nReplace software_collection  with a space-separated list of Software Collections you want to use and command  with the command you want to run. For\\nexample, to execute a Perl program stored in a file named hello.pl with the Perl interpreter from the perl526  Software Collection, type:\\n~]$ scl enable rh-perl526 \\'perl hello.pl\\'\\nHello, World!\\nYou can execute any command using the scl utility , causing it to be run with the executables from a selected Software Collection in preference to their\\npossible Red Hat Enterprise Linux system equivalents. For a complete list of Software Collections that are distributed with Red Hat Software Collections,\\nsee Table 1.1, “Red Hat Software Collections Components” .3.1.2. Running a Shell Session with a Software Collection as Default\\nTo start a new shell session with executables from a selected Software Collection in preference to their Red Hat Enterprise Linux equivalents, type the\\nfollowing at a shell prompt:\\nscl enable software_collection ... bash\\nReplace software_collection  with a space-separated list of Software Collections you want to use. For example, to start a new shell session with the\\npython27  and rh-postgresql10  Software Collections as default, type:\\n~]$ scl enable python27 rh-postgresql10 bash\\nThe list of Software Collections that are enabled in the current session is stored in the $X_SCLS environment variable, for instance:\\n~]$ echo $X_SCLS\\npython27 rh-postgresql10\\nFor a complete list of Software Collections that are distributed with Red Hat Software Collections, see Table 1.1, “Red Hat Software Collections\\nComponents” .\\n3.1.3. Running a System Service from a Software Collection\\nRunning a System Service from a Software Collection in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6\\nSoftware Collections that include system services install corresponding init scripts in the /etc/rc.d/init.d/ directory . To start such a service in the\\ncurrent session, type the following at a shell prompt as root:\\nservice software_collection -service_name  start\\nReplace software_collection  with the name of the Software Collection and service_name  with the name of the service you want to start.\\nTo configure this service to start automatically at boot time, type the following command as root:\\nchkconfig software_collection -service_name  on\\nFor example, to start the postgresql service from the rh-postgresql96  Software Collection and enable it in runlevels 2, 3, 4, and 5, type as root:\\n~]# service rh-postgresql96-postgresql start\\nStarting rh-postgresql96-postgresql service:                  [  OK  ]\\n~]# chkconfig rh-postgresql96-postgresql on\\nFor more information on how to manage system services in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Deployment Guide . For\\na complete list of Software Collections that are distributed with Red Hat Software Collections, see Table 1.1, “Red Hat Software Collections\\nComponents” .\\nRunning a System Service from a Software Collection in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7\\nIn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, init scripts have been replaced by systemd service unit files, which end with the .service file extension and serve a\\nsimilar purpose as init scripts. To start a service in the current session, execute the following command as root:\\nsystemctl start software_collection -service_name .service\\nReplace software_collection  with the name of the Software Collection and service_name  with the name of the service you want to start.\\nTo configure this service to start automatically at boot time, type the following command as root:\\nsystemctl enable software_collection -service_name .service\\nFor example, to start the postgresql service from the rh-postgresql10  Software Collection and enable it at boot time, type as root:\\n~]# systemctl start rh-postgresql10-postgresql.service\\n~]# systemctl enable rh-postgresql10-postgresql.service\\nFor more information on how to manage system services in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 System Administrator\\'s\\nGuide . For a complete list of Software Collections that are distributed with Red Hat Software Collections, see Table 1.1, “Red Hat Software Collections\\nComponents” .\\n3.2. Accessing a Manual Page from a Software Collection\\nEvery Software Collection contains a general manual page that describes the content of this component. Each manual page has the same name as the\\ncomponent and it is located in the /opt/rh directory .\\nTo read a manual page for a Software Collection, type the following command:\\nscl enable software_collection  \\'man software_collection \\'\\nReplace software_collection  with the particular Red Hat Software Collections component. For example, to display the manual page for rh-mariadb102 ,\\ntype:\\n~]$ scl enable rh-mariadb102 \"man rh-mariadb102\"3.3. Deploying Applications That Use Red Hat Software Collections\\nIn general, you can use one of the following two approaches to deploy an application that depends on a component from Red Hat Software Collections\\nin production:\\nInstall all required Software Collections and packages manually and then deploy your application, or\\nCreate a new Software Collection for your application and specify all required Software Collections and other packages as dependencies.\\nFor more information on how to manually install individual Red Hat Software Collections components, see Section 2.2, “Installing Red Hat\\nSoftware Collections” . For further details on how to use Red Hat Software Collections, see Section 3.1, “Using Red Hat Software Collections” .

Migration\\nThis chapter provides information on migrating to versions of components included in Red Hat Software Collections 3.5.\\n5.1. Migrating to MariaDB 10.3\\nThe rh-mariadb103  Software Collection is available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, which includes MariaDB 5.5  as the default MySQL  implementation.\\nThe rh-mariadb103  Software Collection does not conflict with the mysql  or mariadb  packages from the core systems. Unless the *-syspaths  packages\\nare installed (see below), it is possible to install the rh-mariadb103  Software Collection together with the mysql  or mariadb  packages. It is also possible\\nto run both versions at the same time, however , the port number and the socket in the my.cnf files need to be changed to prevent these specific\\nresources from conflicting. Additionally , it is possible to install the rh-mariadb103  Software Collection while the rh-mariadb102  Collection is still installed\\nand even running.\\nThe rh-mariadb103  Software Collection includes the rh-mariadb103-syspaths  package, which installs packages that provide system-wide wrappers for\\nbinaries, scripts, manual pages, and other . After installing the rh-mariadb103*-syspaths  packages, users are not required to use the scl enable\\ncommand for correct functioning of the binaries and scripts provided by the rh-mariadb103*  packages. Note that the *-syspaths  packages conflict with\\nthe corresponding packages from the base Red Hat Enterprise Linux system and from the rh-mariadb102  and rh-mysql80  Software Collections. To find\\nout more about syspaths , see the Red Hat Software Collections Packaging Guide .\\nThe recommended migration path from MariaDB 5.5  to MariaDB 10.3  is to upgrade to MariaDB 10.0  first, and then upgrade by one version\\nsuccessively . For details, see instructions in earlier Red Hat Software Collections Release Notes: Migrating to MariaDB 10.0 , Migrating to MariaDB 10.1 ,\\nand Migrating to MariaDB 10.2 .\\nNote\\nThe rh-mariadb103  Software Collection supports neither mounting over NFS nor dynamical registering using the scl register command.\\n5.1.1. Notable Dif ferences Between the rh-mariadb102  and rh-mariadb103  Software Collections\\nThe mariadb-bench  subpackage has been removed.\\nThe default allowed level of the plug-in maturity has been changed to one level less than the server maturity . As a result, plug-ins with a lower\\nmaturity level that were previously working, will no longer load.\\nFor more information regarding MariaDB 10.3 , see the upstream documentation about changes  and about upgrading .\\n5.1.2. Upgrading from the rh-mariadb102  to the rh-mariadb103  Software Collection\\nImportant\\nPrior to upgrading, back up all your data, including any MariaDB databases.\\n1. Stop the rh-mariadb102  database server if it is still running.\\nBefore stopping the server , set the innodb_fast_shutdown option to 0, so that InnoDB performs a slow shutdown, including a full purge and\\ninsert buf fer merge. Read more about this option in the upstream documentation . This operation can take a longer time than in case of a normal\\nshutdown.\\nmysql -uroot -p -e \"SET GLOBAL innodb_fast_shutdown = 0\"Stop the rh-mariadb102  server .\\nsystemctl stop rh-mariadb102-mariadb.service\\n2. Install the rh-mariadb103  Software Collection, including the subpackage providing the mysql_upgrade  utility .\\nyum install rh-mariadb103-mariadb-server rh-mariadb103-mariadb-server-utils\\nNote that it is possible to install the rh-mariadb103  Software Collection while the rh-mariadb102  Software Collection is still installed because these\\nCollections do not conflict.\\n3. Inspect configuration of rh-mariadb103 , which is stored in the /etc/opt/rh/rh-mariadb103/my.cnf file and the /etc/opt/rh/rh-\\nmariadb103/my.cnf.d/ directory . Compare it with configuration of rh-mariadb102  stored in /etc/opt/rh/rh-mariadb102/my.cnf and\\n/etc/opt/rh/rh-mariadb102/my.cnf.d/ and adjust it if necessary .\\n4. All data of the rh-mariadb102  Software Collection is stored in the /var/opt/rh/rh-mariadb102/lib/mysql/ directory unless configured dif ferently .\\nCopy the whole content of this directory to /var/opt/rh/rh-mariadb103/lib/mysql/. You can move the content but remember to back up your\\ndata before you continue to upgrade. Make sure the data are owned by the mysql user and SELinux context is correct.\\n5. Start the rh-mariadb103  database server .\\nsystemctl start rh-mariadb103-mariadb.service\\n6. Perform the data migration. Note that running the mysql_upgrade command is required due to upstream changes introduced in MDEV -14637 .\\nscl enable rh-mariadb103 mysql_upgrade\\nIf the root user has a non-empty password defined (it should have a password defined), it is necessary to call the mysql_upgrade  utility with the\\n-p option and specify the password.\\nscl enable rh-mariadb103 -- mysql_upgrade -p\\nNote that when the rh-mariadb103*-syspaths  packages are installed, the scl enable command is not required. However , the *-syspaths\\npackages conflict with the corresponding packages from the base Red Hat Enterprise Linux system and from the rh-mariadb102  and rh-mysql80\\nSoftware Collections.\\n5.2. Migrating to MariaDB 10.2\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 contains MySQL  5.1 as the default MySQL  implementation. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 includes MariaDB 5.5  as the default\\nMySQL  implementation. MariaDB  is a community-developed drop-in replacement for MySQL .

Notable Dif ferences Between MySQL  5.7 and MySQL  8.0\\nDifferences Specific to the rh-mysql80  Software Collection\\nThe MySQL  8.0 server provided by the rh-mysql80  Software Collection is configured to use mysql_native_password as the default authentication\\nplug-in because client tools and libraries in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 are incompatible with the caching_sha2_password method, which is used\\nby default in the upstream MySQL  8.0 version.\\nTo change the default authentication plug-in to caching_sha2_password, edit the /etc/opt/rh/rh-mysql80/my.cnf.d/mysql-default-\\nauthentication-plugin.cnf file as follows:\\n[mysqld]\\ndefault_authentication_plugin=caching_sha2_password\\nFor more information about the caching_sha2_password authentication plug-in, see the upstream documentation .\\nThe rh-mysql80  Software Collection includes the rh-mysql80-syspaths  package, which installs the rh-mysql80-mysql-config-syspaths , rh-mysql80-\\nmysql-server-syspaths , and rh-mysql80-mysql-syspaths  packages. These subpackages provide system-wide wrappers for binaries, scripts,\\nmanual pages, and other . After installing the rh-mysql80*-syspaths  packages, users are not required to use the scl enable command for correct\\nfunctioning of the binaries and scripts provided by the rh-mysql80*  packages. Note that the *-syspaths  packages conflict with the corresponding\\npackages from the base Red Hat Enterprise Linux system and from the rh-mariadb102  and rh-mariadb103  Software Collections. To find out more\\nabout syspaths , see the Red Hat Software Collections Packaging Guide .\\nGeneral Changes in MySQL  8.0\\nBinary logging is enabled by default during the server startup. The log_bin system variable is now set to ON by default even if the --log-bin\\noption has not been specified. To disable binary logging, specify the --skip-log-bin or --disable-log-bin option at startup.\\nFor a CREATE FUNCTION statement to be accepted, at least one of the DETERMINISTIC, NO SQL, or READS SQL DATA keywords must be specified\\nexplicitly , otherwise an error occurs.\\nCertain features related to account management have been removed. Namely , using the GRANT statement to modify account properties other than\\nprivilege assignments, such as authentication, SSL, and resource-limit, is no longer possible. To establish the mentioned properties at account-\\ncreation time, use the CREATE USER statement. To modify these properties, use the ALTER USER statement.\\nCertain SSL-related options have been removed on the client-side. Use the --ssl-mode=REQUIRED option instead of --ssl=1 or --enable-ssl.\\nUse the --ssl-mode=DISABLED option instead of --ssl=0, --skip-ssl, or --disable-ssl. Use the --ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY option instead\\nof --ssl-verify-server-cert options. Note that these option remains unchanged on the server side.The default character set has been changed from latin1 to utf8mb4.\\nThe utf8 character set is currently an alias for utf8mb3 but in the future, it will become a reference to utf8mb4. To prevent ambiguity , specify\\nutf8mb4 explicitly for character set references instead of utf8.\\nSetting user variables in statements other than SET has been deprecated.\\nThe log_syslog variable, which previously configured error logging to the system logs, has been removed.\\nCertain incompatible changes to spatial data support have been introduced.\\nThe deprecated ASC or DESC qualifiers for GROUP BY clauses have been removed. To produce a given sort order , provide an ORDER BY clause.\\nFor detailed changes in MySQL  8.0 compared to earlier versions, see the upstream documentation: What Is New in MySQL  8.0 and Changes Affecting\\nUpgrades to MySQL  8.0.\\n5.3.2.

Otherwise only the postgres user will be allowed to access the database.\\n5.7. Migrating to PostgreSQL  9.6\\nPostgreSQL  9.6 is available for both Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and it can be safely installed on the same machine in\\nparallel with PostgreSQL  8.4 from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, PostgreSQL  9.2 from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, or any version of PostgreSQL\\nreleased in previous versions of Red Hat Software Collections. It is also possible to run more than one version of PostgreSQL  on a machine at the\\nsame time, but you need to use dif ferent ports or IP  addresses and adjust SELinux policy .\\nImportant\\nIn case of upgrading the PostgreSQL  database in a container , see the container-specific instructions . Note that it is currently impossible to upgrade\\nPostgreSQL  from 9.5 to 9.6 in a container in an OpenShift environment that is configured with Gluster file volumes.\\n5.7.1. Notable Dif ferences Between PostgreSQL  9.5 and PostgreSQL  9.6\\nThe most notable changes between PostgreSQL  9.5 and PostgreSQL  9.6 are described in the upstream release notes .\\nThe rh-postgresql96  Software Collection includes the rh-postgresql96-syspaths  package, which installs packages that provide system-wide wrappers for\\nbinaries, scripts, manual pages, and other . After installing the rh-postgreqsl96*-syspaths  packages, users are not required to use the scl enable\\ncommand for correct functioning of the binaries and scripts provided by the rh-postgreqsl96*  packages. Note that the *-syspaths  packages conflict with\\nthe corresponding packages from the base Red Hat Enterprise Linux system. To find out more about syspaths , see the Red Hat Software Collections\\nPackaging Guide .\\nThe following table provides an overview of dif ferent paths in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system version of PostgreSQL  (postgresql ) and in the\\npostgresql92 , rh-postgresql95 , and rh-postgresql96  Software Collections. Note that the paths of PostgreSQL  8.4 distributed with Red Hat\\nEnterprise Linux 6 and the system version of PostgreSQL  9.2 shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 are the same; the paths for the rh-postgresql94\\nSoftware Collection are analogous to rh-postgresql95 .\\nTable 5.2.

For dif ferences between PostgreSQL  9.4 and\\nPostgreSQL  9.5, refer to Red Hat Software Collections 2.2 Release Notes .\\n5.7.2. Migrating from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux System V ersion of PostgreSQL  to the PostgreSQL  9.6 Software Collection\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 includes PostgreSQL  8.4, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is distributed with PostgreSQL  9.2. To migrate your data from a\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux system version of PostgreSQL  to the rh-postgresql96  Software Collection, you can either perform a fast upgrade using the\\npg_upgrade tool (recommended), or dump the database data into a text file with SQL  commands and import it in the new database. Note that the\\nsecond method is usually significantly slower and may require manual fixes; see the PostgreSQL  documentation  for more information about this\\nupgrade method. The following procedures are applicable for both Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system versions of\\nPostgreSQL .\\nImportant\\nBefore migrating your data from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system version of PostgreSQL  to PostgreSQL  9.6, make sure that you back up all your\\ndata, including the PostgreSQL  database files, which are by default  located in the /var/lib/pgsql/data/ directory .\\nProcedure 5.5. Fast Upgrade Using the pg_upgrade Tool\\nTo perform a fast upgrade of your PostgreSQL  server , complete the following steps:\\n1. Stop the old PostgreSQL  server to ensure that the data is not in an inconsistent state. To do so, type the following at a shell prompt as root:\\nservice postgresql stop\\nTo verify that the server is not running, type:\\nservice postgresql status\\n2. Verify that the old directory /var/lib/pgsql/data/ exists:\\nfile /var/lib/pgsql/data/\\nand back up your data.\\n3. Verify that the new data directory /var/opt/rh/rh-postgresql96/lib/pgsql/data/ does not exist:\\nfile /var/opt/rh/rh-postgresql96/lib/pgsql/data/\\nIf you are running a fresh installation of PostgreSQL  9.6, this directory should not be present in your system. If it is, back it up by running the\\nfollowing command as root:\\nmv /var/opt/rh/rh-postgresql96/lib/pgsql/data{,-scl-backup}\\n4. Upgrade the database data for the new server by running the following command as root:\\nscl enable rh-postgresql96 -- postgresql-setup --upgrade\\nAlternatively , you can use the /opt/rh/rh-postgresql96/root/usr/bin/postgresql-setup --upgrade command.\\nNote that you can use the --upgrade-from option for upgrade from dif ferent versions of PostgreSQL . The list of possible upgrade scenarios is\\navailable using the --upgrade-ids option.\\nIt is recommended that you read the resulting /var/lib/pgsql/upgrade_rh-postgresql96-postgresql.log log file to find out if any problems\\noccurred during the upgrade.\\n5. Start the new server as root:\\nservice rh-postgresql96-postgresql start\\nIt is also advised that you run the analyze_new_cluster.sh script as follows:\\nsu - postgres -c \\'scl enable rh-postgresql96 ~/analyze_new_cluster.sh\\'\\n6. Optionally , you can configure the PostgreSQL  9.6 server to start automatically at boot time. To disable the old system PostgreSQL  server , type the\\nfollowing command as root:\\nchkconfig postgresql off\\nTo enable the PostgreSQL  9.6 server , type as root:\\nchkconfig rh-postgresql96-postgresql on\\n7. If your configuration dif fers from the default one, make sure to update configuration files, especially the /var/opt/rh/rh-\\npostgresql96/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf configuration file. Otherwise only the postgres user will be allowed to access the database.Procedure 5.6. Performing a Dump and Restore Upgrade\\nTo perform a dump and restore upgrade of your PostgreSQL  server , complete the following steps:\\n1. Ensure that the old PostgreSQL  server is running by typing the following at a shell prompt as root:\\nservice postgresql start\\n2. Dump all data in the PostgreSQL  database into a script file. As root, type:\\nsu - postgres -c \\'pg_dumpall > ~/pgdump_file.sql\\'\\n3. Stop the old server by running the following command as root:\\nservice postgresql stop\\n4. Initialize the data directory for the new server as root:\\nscl enable rh-postgresql96-postgresql -- postgresql-setup --initdb\\n5. Start the new server as root:\\nservice rh-postgresql96-postgresql start\\n6. Import data from the previously created SQL  file:\\nsu - postgres -c \\'scl enable rh-postgresql96 \"psql -f ~/pgdump_file.sql postgres\"\\'\\n7. Optionally , you can configure the PostgreSQL  9.6 server to start automatically at boot time. To disable the old system PostgreSQL  server , type the\\nfollowing command as root:\\nchkconfig postgresql off\\nTo enable the PostgreSQL  9.6 server , type as root:\\nchkconfig rh-postgresql96-postgresql on\\n8. If your configuration dif fers from the default one, make sure to update configuration files, especially the /var/opt/rh/rh-\\npostgresql96/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf configuration file. Otherwise only the postgres user will be allowed to access the database.\\n5.7.3. Migrating from the PostgreSQL  9.5 Software Collection to the PostgreSQL  9.6 Software Collection\\nTo migrate your data from the rh-postgresql95  Software Collection to the rh-postgresql96  Collection, you can either perform a fast upgrade using the\\npg_upgrade tool (recommended), or dump the database data into a text file with SQL  commands and import it in the new database. Note that the\\nsecond method is usually significantly slower and may require manual fixes; see the PostgreSQL  documentation  for more information about this\\nupgrade method.\\nImportant\\nBefore migrating your data from PostgreSQL  9.5 to PostgreSQL  9.6, make sure that you back up all your data, including the PostgreSQL  database\\nfiles, which are by default located in the /var/opt/rh/rh-postgresql95/lib/pgsql/data/ directory .\\nProcedure 5.7.

If your configuration dif fers from the default one, make sure to update configuration files, especially the /var/opt/rh/rh-\\npostgresql96/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf configuration file. Otherwise only the postgres user will be allowed to access the database.\\nProcedure 5.8. Performing a Dump and Restore Upgrade\\nTo perform a dump and restore upgrade of your PostgreSQL  server , complete the following steps:\\n1. Ensure that the old PostgreSQL  server is running by typing the following at a shell prompt as root:\\nservice rh-postgresql95-postgresql start\\n2. Dump all data in the PostgreSQL  database into a script file. As root, type:\\nsu - postgres -c \\'scl enable rh-postgresql95 \"pg_dumpall > ~/pgdump_file.sql\"\\'\\n3.

If your configuration dif fers from the default one, make sure to update configuration files, especially the /var/opt/rh/rh-\\npostgresql96/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf configuration file. Otherwise only the postgres user will be allowed to access the database.\\nIf you need to migrate from the postgresql92  Software Collection, refer to Red Hat Software Collections 2.0 Release Notes ; the procedure is the same,\\nyou just need to adjust the version of the new Collection. The same applies to migration from the rh-postgresql94  Software Collection, which is\\ndescribed in Red Hat Software Collections 2.2 Release Notes .\\n5.8. Migrating to nginx 1.16\\nThe root directory for the rh-nginx1 16 Software Collection is located in /opt/rh/rh-nginx116/root/. The error log is stored in /var/opt/rh/rh-\\nnginx116/log/nginx by default.\\nConfiguration files are stored in the /etc/opt/rh/rh-nginx116/nginx/ directory . Configuration files in nginx 1.16  have the same syntax and largely the\\nsame format as previous nginx  Software Collections.\\nConfiguration files (with a .conf extension) in the /etc/opt/rh/rh-nginx116/nginx/default.d/ directory are included in the default server block\\nconfiguration for port 80.\\nImportantBefore upgrading from nginx 1.14  to nginx 1.16 , back up all your data, including web pages located in the /opt/rh/nginx114/root/ tree and\\nconfiguration files located in the /etc/opt/rh/nginx114/nginx/ tree.\\nIf you have made any specific changes, such as changing configuration files or setting up web applications, in the /opt/rh/nginx114/root/ tree,\\nreplicate those changes in the new /opt/rh/rh-nginx116/root/ and /etc/opt/rh/rh-nginx116/nginx/ directories, too.\\nYou can use this procedure to upgrade directly from nginx 1.8 , nginx 1.10 , nginx 1.12 , or nginx 1.14  to nginx 1.16 . Use the appropriate paths in this\\ncase.\\nFor the of ficial nginx  documentation, refer to http://nginx.org/en/docs/ .\\n5.9. Migrating to Redis 5\\nRedis 3.2 , provided by the rh-redis32  Software Collection, is mostly a strict subset of Redis 4.0 , which is mostly a strict subset of Redis 5.0 . Therefore,\\nno major issues should occur when upgrading from version 3.2 to version 5.0.\\nTo upgrade a Redis  Cluster to version 5.0, a mass restart of all the instances is needed.\\nCompatibility Notes\\nThe format of RDB files has been changed. Redis 5  is able to read formats of all the earlier versions, but earlier versions are incapable of reading\\nthe Redis 5  format.\\nSince version 4.0, the Redis  Cluster bus protocol is no longer compatible with Redis 3.2 .\\nFor minor non-backward compatible changes, see the upstream release notes for version 4.0  and version 5.0 .\\nChapter 6.
